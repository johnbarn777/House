## 📱 **Features Overview**

### 🧹 **Smart Chore Management**
*Take the friction out of dividing household labor.*

A robust system designed to handle the complexities of chore distribution fairly and transparently.

- **Assignment Logic**:
    - **Direct Assignment**: Assign specific tasks to individual roommates.
    - **Round-Robin Rotation**: Automatically rotate recurring chores (e.g., "Take out trash") between selected members to ensure fairness.
    - **Open-for-Grabs**: Post unassigned chores that any member can claim for extra points.
- **Lifecycle Management**:
    - **Mark Complete**: Simple swipe-to-complete actions with optional **photo verification** and **completion notes** (e.g., upload a picture of the clean sink!).
    - **Undo Completion**: Accidentally marked a task as done? Easily un-complete it to restore it to the active list.
    - **Delay/Snooze**: Life happens. Request a delay on a chore with a required "Reason" note (e.g., "Working late"). Housemates are notified and can approve/acknowledge.
    - **Edit & Delete**: Admins or task creators can modify details, due dates, or remove chores entirely.
- **Notifications**:
    - Reminders for due tasks, overdue alerts, and notifications when a assigned chore is completed by someone else.

### 🥦 **Digital Fridge & Pantry**
*Never run out of the essentials again.*

A collaborative inventory system to track shared groceries and supplies.

- **Inventory Dashboard**:
    - Visual grid/list of tracked items (Milk, Eggs, Toilet Paper, Detergent).
    - **Status Indicators**:
        - 🟢 **Available**: Item is in stock.
        - 🟡 **Low**: Item is running low (notify user next time they are at the shop).
        - 🔴 **Out of Stock**: Item is gone. Automatically prompts to add to the Shopping List.
- **Smart Shopping List**:
    - A centralized list synced in real-time.
    - One-tap "I bought it" action that moves items from the shopping list back to "In Stock".
    - Categorization (Produce, Dairy, Household) for efficient shopping trips.

###  **House Notes & Notices**
*Effective communication without the group chat clutter.*

A dedicated space for house announcements, reminders, and rules.

- **Pinned Notices**: High-priority alerts that stay at the top (e.g., "Landlord inspection on Friday", "Quiet hours after 10 PM").
- **General Notes**: A digital whiteboard for non-urgent messages (e.g., "Leftovers in the fridge are for everyone").
- **Urgency Levels**:
    - ℹ️ **Info**: General FYIs.
    - ⚠️ **Important**: Please read (e.g., "Bill due").
    - 🚨 **Urgent**: Immediate attention required (e.g., "Leak in bathroom").

### 🎮 **Gamification**
*Make contribution fun and rewarding.*

Incentivize participation and create a positive feedback loop for household maintenance.

- **Points System**:
    - Earn points for completing chores (weighted by difficulty/effort).
    - Bonus points for maintaining a streak or picking up "Open-for-Grabs" tasks.
    - Deductions (optional) for significantly overdue items.
- **Leaderboards**:
    - **Weekly/Monthly Standings**: See who is carrying the team!
    - **All-Time Stats**: Track total tasks completed.
- **Streaks**: Visual indicators (🔥) for housemates who have completed their daily/weekly tasks on time consecutively.
- **Rewards**:
    - Customizable house perks for winners (e.g., "Winner doesn't have to clean the bathroom next week", "Loser buys pizza").
